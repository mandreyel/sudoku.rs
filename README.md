# sudoku.rs

A sudoku solver that I wrote out of curiosity. I presume it's rather slow since
  I've come up with the algorithm on my own. I might improve it in the future.
  This was written in a short time frame so the code is accordingly ugly, and
  since I've mostly satisfied my curiosity, I'll probably not return to this.
